installinvg vim-plug:

curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

enter vim config: ~/.vimrc

and add the lines:

call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')


call plug#end()

Now, add lines like Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree' in between those lines, and close out of ~/.vimrc.
Then, go back into .vimrc using vim and do the command :PlugInstall

You can add lines in vim config like:

map <C-f> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

(maps control-f to do :NERDTreeToggle, followed by carriage return

For coc.nvim, I had to install node, so i went ahead and did that.
